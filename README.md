# TwitterBots
So for this project, you need to enter in your own twitter credentials (in twitter4j.properties) to interface with the twitter API. These can be found at https://dev.twitter.com/ under Manage Your Apps. 

This is a very simple bot that tweets each line of text in the text file. I use regular expressions to format the lines in my text file to <140 character tweets.

Twitter Robots built in Java using the Twitter4j Library (http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html)
